This is it! Congratulations on setting up an instance of influxdb!

Now you can setup an instance of influxdb using docker on your own server. You also learned how to configure telegraf to monitor the resources of your own server. Keep in mind: the sky is the limit! There is a wide range of plugins that you can use and experiment with. Telegraf alone offers over 200+ different plugins for all kind of hardware, software and applications[[5]](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.22/plugins/). To make efficient use of influxdb, checkout the Flux language or dive into using the query builder. You've learned how to create graphs and how to customize your dashboard, now its time to create a new one with a different plugin and use all kind of fancy graphs!

Thank you for your patience. I hope you enjoyed this scenario and learned something new!
