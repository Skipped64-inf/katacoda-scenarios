# InfluxDB
In this scenario you'll learn how to install and use the open-source time series database InfluxDB.

A time series database are based on Key-Value pairs where the key will be a timestamp. This is especially useful for usecases where you are monitoring data over time.

The scenario will first focus on the installation and setup of an instance of InfluxDB. After the setup is complete, you will learn how to integrate timestamped data in the database and how to use it. While exploring the possibilites you will learn why this makes sense and what usecases can profit from the time based design.
